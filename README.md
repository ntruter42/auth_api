## [Authentication API (WIP) üöÄ](https://auth-api-jxor.onrender.com/)

**_This is just an API üîÑ, nothing much to see here üëÄ_**

**_Usage instructions coming soon... üìë‚è≤_**


## Requirements (Generated using ChatGPT)

	User Registration:
        Create an endpoint for user registration, typically using a POST request.
        Validate user input, including username, email, and password.
        Hash and securely store the user's password in a database.
        Generate and store a unique token or session to maintain user authentication.

    User Login:
        Create an endpoint for user login, typically using a POST request.
        Validate the user's credentials (username/email and password).
        Compare the provided password with the hashed password stored during registration.
        If the credentials are valid, generate a new token or session for the user and return it.

    Authentication Middleware:
        Create a middleware function to authenticate incoming requests. This middleware should verify the user's token or session.
        Protect routes and resources that require authentication by applying the authentication middleware.

    Password Reset (optional):
        Implement a password reset feature that allows users to request a password reset link or token.
        Create an endpoint to handle password reset requests and validate them securely.

    User Profile and Management:
        Create endpoints to retrieve and update user profiles.
        Implement functionality to change passwords, update user information, and log out.

    Error Handling:
        Implement error handling to provide meaningful error responses for various scenarios, such as incorrect credentials, validation errors, and server errors.

    Security Considerations:
        Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to protect user passwords.
        Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
        Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
        Protect against common security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

    User Sessions and Tokens:
        Choose an appropriate session management approach (e.g., JWT or session cookies) and implement it securely.
        Handle token expiration, renewal, and revocation as needed.

    User Experience:
        Implement user-friendly responses, such as sending appropriate status codes and error messages.
        Consider adding user feedback for successful operations (e.g., registration or password reset confirmation).

    Testing and Documentation:
        Write unit tests to ensure the functionality is working as expected.
        Document your API endpoints, request/response formats, and any authentication requirements.

## Endpoints (Generated using ChatGPT)

	User Registration:
        Endpoint: /api/register
        HTTP Method: POST

    User Login:
        Endpoint: <span style="background-color: /api/login
        HTTP Method: POST

    Authentication Middleware:
        There's no specific endpoint for the middleware, but you can apply it to protected routes. For example:
        Protected Resource: /api/user/profile
        Middleware: Applied to the /api/user/* routes to ensure authentication.

    Password Reset (optional):
        Endpoint for requesting a password reset: /api/forgot-password
        Endpoint for resetting the password after receiving the reset token: /api/reset-password
        HTTP Methods: POST for both

    User Profile and Management:
        Endpoint for retrieving user profile: /api/user/profile
        HTTP Method: GET
        Endpoint for updating user profile: /api/user/profile
        HTTP Method: PUT or PATCH
        Endpoint for changing the password: /api/user/change-password
        HTTP Method: POST or PUT
        Endpoint for logging out: /api/logout
        HTTP Method: POST

    Error Handling:
        There aren't specific endpoints for error handling, but you should provide meaningful error responses for various scenarios within your endpoints.

    Security Considerations:
        There are no specific endpoints for security considerations, but you should implement security measures throughout the API, such as using HTTPS, rate limiting, and protecting against common vulnerabilities.

    User Sessions and Tokens:
        Endpoint for token or session management, such as refreshing or revoking tokens: /api/token
        HTTP Methods: POST (for token refresh), DELETE (for token revocation)

    User Experience:
        There are no specific endpoints for user experience, but you should send appropriate status codes and error messages in the responses.

    Testing and Documentation:
        While not actual API endpoints, you should have dedicated routes or documentation for testing and documenting your API.

## Practices (Generated using ChatGPT)

    Use HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Password Hashing: Store user passwords securely by hashing them using a strong, well-established hashing algorithm like bcrypt. Never store plain text passwords.

    Salt Passwords: Use a unique salt for each user to prevent rainbow table attacks. The salt should be randomly generated and stored with the password hash.

    Implement Rate Limiting: Protect your API against brute force attacks by implementing rate limiting. Limit the number of failed login attempts from the same IP address.

    User Input Validation: Sanitize and validate user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

    Use Prepared Statements: If your API interacts with a database, use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

    JWT (JSON Web Tokens): If using JWT for authentication, make sure to sign tokens with a strong, unique secret key. Also, consider token expiration and revocation mechanisms.

    Secure Session Management: If using sessions, store them securely, and make sure they are invalidated upon user logout or after a certain period of inactivity.

    Protect Against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Implement anti-CSRF tokens to prevent unauthorized actions by malicious sites using a user's authenticated session.

    Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded, mitigating XSS attacks.

    Input Sanitization: Use libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks.

    Error Handling: Provide minimal error information in responses to avoid exposing sensitive information. Log errors securely.

    Sensitive Data Handling: Avoid storing sensitive user data in client-side storage like cookies. Store them securely on the server and transmit them via secure channels.

    Token Revocation: Implement mechanisms for token revocation in case a user logs out or for security reasons.

    API Versioning: Include versioning in your API to ensure that changes in your authentication methods do not break existing clients.

    Third-party Libraries: Keep third-party libraries and dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

    Security Headers: Implement security-related HTTP headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to mitigate various web vulnerabilities.

    Authentication Logging: Implement logging to monitor and detect suspicious activities or security breaches.

    Third-party Sign-In: If implementing third-party (social) sign-in, follow best practices and ensure that user data is handled securely.

    Security Audits: Periodically conduct security audits and code reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities.

    Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep all software components, including Express.js and its dependencies, up to date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

    Security Education: Train your development team on security best practices and conduct regular security awareness training.
